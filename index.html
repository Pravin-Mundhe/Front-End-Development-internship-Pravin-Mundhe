        <p>Poseidon, the God of the sea, is Zeus’s brother from the underworld. He is usually characterized by a carefree and quick temperament, portrayed with green skin and long, wavy hair.

        <p>Demeter, the harvest goddess, is Persephone’s overprotective mother. She is a tall, green woman with long red hair. Her stern and controlling nature stemmed from a deep-seated fear of what her daughter could do and the dangers she faced.</p>
